ie.manual.entry.alternator1=To work, it needs a kinetic energy generator connected to it (<link;steamTurbine;§n§oSteam Turbine§r>). The kinetic energy input is at the back of the machine (where the Sheetmetal Blocks are) and the Flux outputs are on front-left and front-right. The machine produces up to <config;i;alternator_energyPerTick> Flux/t depending on the Speed.<br>The Alternator can store <config;i;alternator_energyStorage> Flux, outputting <config;i;alternator_energyPerTickPerPort> Flux/t per port.

ie.manual.entry.boiler.name=Boiler
ie.manual.entry.boiler.subtext=A fluid fuel method
ie.manual.entry.boiler0=The Boiler is a multiblock structure that uses fluid fuel and Water to produce Steam.<br>The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the central Sheetmetal Iron Block (long side).

ie.manual.entry.openBarrel0=The §6Open Metal Barrel§r is a single block tank like the Metal Barrel but with an open top. Fluid can be put in by hand. The Top is Input only and the Bottom is Output only. Leave it out in the Rain and watch it fill! In a Thunderstom Twice as fast! However, don't leave it out in warm environments, water just may evaporate.

ie.manual.entry.solarTower.name=Solar Tower
ie.manual.entry.solarTower.subtext=The power of the Sun
ie.manual.entry.solarTower0=The Solar Tower is a multiblock structure that uses the light of the Sun to transform water in steam.<br>The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the central Redstone Engineering
ie.manual.entry.solarTower1=Block.<br>The Solar Tower can produce Steam from Water and <link;distiller;§n§oDistilled Water§r>.<br>One Bucket of Distilled Water produces 3000 mB of Steam.<br>One Bucket of Water produces 2000 mB of Steam.<br>Water can be input into the Solar Tower via the two hatches on the left and the right that are marked with blue dots.

ie.manual.entry.solarTower2=The Solar Reflector is a multiblock structure that reflects the light of the Sun to the center of the Solar Tower.<br>The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the central Silver Block. 
ie.manual.entry.solarTower3=To work, there must not be any blocks between it, the Solar Tower, and at the top of the reflector. The reflector's center silver block must align with the center of the Solar Tower. Also the distance between the reflector and the Solar Tower must be between <config;i;solarTower_minRange>-<config;i;solarTower_maxRange> blocks. Obviously, it works only during the day.

ie.manual.entry.stackLimiter.name=Stack Limiter
ie.manual.entry.stackLimiter.subtext=Only need a couple items
ie.manual.entry.stackLimiter0=The §6Stack Limiter§r can limit items moving through it. You can specify in the GUI specific paramaters or it can be controlled by Redstone signal strength. Redstone with a signal of 15 is off. Enable Redstone Mode by sneaking with a Hammer.

ie.manual.entry.steamTurbine.name=Steam Turbine
ie.manual.entry.steamTurbine.subtext=Boiling breath
ie.manual.entry.steamTurbine0=The Steam Turbine is a multiblock structure that uses Steam to produce kinetic energy.<br>The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the central Steel Block (short side).
ie.manual.entry.steamTurbine1=When supplied with steam, the Turbine will slowly speed up, reaching maximum speed after <config;i;steamTurbine_timeToMax> seconds, as long it's constantly fed. Turning it off or failing to provide enough steam slows the Turbine down and reduces its power output.<br>To work, it needs an <link;alternator;§o§nAlternator§r>.
ie.manual.entry.steamTurbine2=Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will halt the machine's progress, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.<br>The fluid pipe on front of the machine is the input. The kinetic energy output is in the rear of the machine (Steel Block). Optionally, fluids can be retrieved through the output pipe on the top of the machine.

ie.manual.entry.gasTurbine.name=Gas Turbine
ie.manual.entry.gasTurbine.subtext=Not part of a 747
ie.manual.entry.gasTurbine0=The Gas Turbine is a multiblock structure that uses combustible fuels to produce kinetic energy. The structure is built as shown, and formed by using the Engineer's hammer on the central steel block (short side)
ie.manual.entry.gasTurbine1=When supplied with fuel and ingesting enough air for the combustion process, the turbine will slowly speed up, reaching max speed and efficiency around 30 seconds into the spinup process, as long as it is constantly fed. If the turbine is at speed while shut down, it will slowly lose speed. If it slows down to below 1/4 speed, it will need to be spun back up before it can be used again. Exhaust gas output remains while constant while the turbine burns fuel. <br>To work, it needs an <link;alternator;§o§nAlternator§r>.
ie.manual.entry.gasTurbine2=The fluid pipe on the front of the turbine is the input, and the two power plugs on the sides of the turbine each serve a different input purpose. The HV plug consumes 4096 IF/t to start the turbine up to 1/4 speed, at which point more input will cause the turbine to stall and not spin up past 1/4 speed. The MV plug uses 1024 IF/t to ignite the fuel if the turbine needs to start consuming fuel again - this happens on startup and any time the turbine has no fuel for 3 or more seconds.
ie.manual.entry.gasTurbine3=The turbine outputs kinetic energy from the rear, and the result gasses just below the kinetic energy output. These gasses have a special place, in that they can be burned to increase the efficiency of the turbine.  While usually worse than the diesel generator, for a greater power output and complexity, this output is where the gas turbine really shines. CCGT (or COGAS for the mariners out there) allows huge returns on combustible fuels when used in the boiler for steam power.

ie.manual.entry.steelBarrel.name=Steel Metal Barrel
ie.manual.entry.steelBarrel.subtext=Full to the max!
ie.manual.entry.steelBarrel0=The §6Steel Metal Barrel§r is a single block tank that provides double the space of fluids over a Metal Barrel. Fluid can be put in by hand. The Top and Bottom sides can be configured for input or output with a Hammer.

ie.manual.entry.steelTank.name=Steel Fluid Tank
ie.manual.entry.steelTank.subtext=Full to the max!
ie.manual.entry.steelTank0=The Steel Fluid Tank is a multiblock that provides space for even larger amounts of fluids. It will store up to <config;i;steelTank_tankSize> mB of any fluid, which can be piped in through the top or bottom block. Fluids can only be extracted from the bottom center block.
ie.manual.entry.steelTank1=Applying a redstone signal to the bottom center block will make the tank output automatically, a comparator placed there will emit a redstone signal proportional to how full the tank is. Attaching the comparator to one of the top 4 layers results in a signal proportional to the height of the comparator. For example, a comparator attached to the second layer of a tank would not emit any signal until the tank is 1/4 full and have a signal strength of 15 if the tank is half full or more.

ie.manual.entry.redstone.name=Redstone Timer
ie.manual.entry.redstone.subtext=tick-tock
ie.manual.entry.redstone0=The §6Redstone Timer§r outputs a short redstone signal depending on the delay imposed on it. The delay time can be set in the Timer’s gui and has 0.5 Seconds of precision, and can be adjusted between 0.5 to 10 Seconds. The Timer can be stopped with a redstone signal.

ie.manual.entry.coolingTower.name=Cooling Tower
ie.manual.entry.coolingTower.subtext=Keep it cool, man!
ie.manual.entry.coolingTower0=The Cooling Tower is a multiblock structure that converts exhaust steam back into water. <br>The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the Heavy Engineering block.
ie.manual.entry.coolingTower1=Exhaust Steam goes into the block to the left of the Heavy Engineering block (side with red gauge indicator) while water or distilled water goes into the right one (side with blue gauge indicator).
